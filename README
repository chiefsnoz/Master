Master is a parent program that handles many sub-functions and sub-programs to centralize:
    - work tasks
    - references
    - projects
    - anything else that can possibly be added
Benefits:
    This structural program will enable improvement of:
        - navigation between and within tasks (mainly maximo tickets)
        - file and folder navigation
        - task/project/documentation organization
        - task/project/documentation tracking & optimization of time
        - task direction & process documentation, links, and automation
    These improvements can build little by little upon this structure so it's important to be a solid, smooth Master program
